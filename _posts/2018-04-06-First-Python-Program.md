**Introduction**

In this tutorial, we will learn, how can we create simple python program in python.

Let's start with a classic and tradition program in computer programming, a simple program that displays "Hello, World!".

This tutorial will walk you through writing a “Hello, World” program in Python 3.

`print()` is a built-in **function** that tells the computer to perform an action. We know it is a function because it uses parentheses. `print()` tells Python to display whatever we put in the parentheses.

These built-in functions are always available for us to use in programs that we create.

**Basic Syntax in Python3**

print('Hello, World!')

This produces the result like this
