**First Python Program**

Let ‘s start with a classic and tradition program in computer programming, a simple program that displays “Hello, World!”.

This tutorial will walk you through writing a “Hello, World” program in Python 3.

`print()` is a built-in **function** that tells the computer to perform an action. We know it is a function because it uses parentheses. `print()` tells Python to display whatever we put in the parentheses.

These built-in functions are always available for us to use in programs that we create.  

**Basic Syntax in Python3**

```python
   print('Hello, World!')
```

This produces the result like this:

Inside the parentheses of the function  `print()` is a sequence of characters. Any characters that are inside of quotation marks are called a **string**. We will learn more about string in an upcoming tutorial.
