Welcome to the Stack Overflow podcast #100!! Recorded Thursday, January 26, 2017 at Stack Overflow headquarters in NYC. Today's podcast is brought to you by the [Cheeseburger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheeseburger). "It's a hamburger, topped with cheese!" But the real question is: Is a cheeseburger a sandwich? The podcast is also brought to you by [IBM Compose](https://compose.com/?utm_source=stackexchange&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=stackexchange&utm_content=podcast). Compose has spent the last 5 years helping developers ship applications with production grade databases. Try Compose today and get a free limited edition T-Shirt. Hurry! Quantities are limited. Visit compose.com today. (Unfortunately, t-shirts are US only.)

Calling our guest today 'special' would be an understatement. He's the co-founder of Stack Overflow (and this podcast), founder of [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/), prolific writer and blogger at [codinghorror.com](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), and most importantly, the subject of many internal Stack Overflow memes. It's [@codinghorror](https://twitter.com/codinghorror) himself, Mr Jeff Atwood! Jeff and Joel chat about where we came from and where we are going, including clips from past podcasts. If you care at all about SO history, then this episode is a must-listen. You may also learn a little too much (or not enough?) about how to be a juggalo...

> "Ultimately, [answering] the best questions are kind-of a form of storytelling, and that is what we were trying to get to. You can go and take 5 minutes out of your day, look at some semi-interesting Stack Overflow question and share some knowledge...it's a good feeling." 
> - Jeff Atwood

> "Computing is just typing words into boxes." - also Jeff Atwood

This week's SO Constitution question: **When driving with a friend, is it ok to ask that friend to get out and direct you while parallel parking?** Listen to the opinions of the hosts, and then post your answer to Twitter using the hashtag #stackoverflowpodcast, along with your explanation. Keep it short, but clever! 

The funniest explanation, whether winning or losing, will be read on next week's podcast and win an awesome Stack Overflow Sticker. 

Last week's winner, answering the question: PRO or CON: **Is it pronounced "Data is…" or "Data are…"?**

> "@StackPodcast CON because it's weird to say "Data are my favorite Star Trek character #stackoverflowpodcast" - [@ethanjpeters](https://twitter.com/ethanjpeters/status/823958661680640000)
