Welcome to the Stack Overflow Podcast #102 recorded Thursday, February 23, 2017 at the Stack Overflow HQ in NYC. Today's podcast is brought to you by rogue cows and SHA-1. [SHA-1](http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/23/14712118/google-sha1-collision-broken-web-encryption-shattered): You can depend on it.

Topics discussed this week (with only minor IT interruptions) include the [Dell XPS-13](http://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/productdetails/xps-13-9360-laptop), Macbook Pro touch bars, and [ugh, Uber](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber)â€¦ 

Our special guest this week is [Erica Brescia](http://www.femalefounderstories.com/erica-brescia.html), co-founder and COO at [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/). She speaks to us about her passion for dev tools as well as the challenges of being a predominantly remote company (something that SO knows a little bit about). Also, castle retreats? Yes please.

In our ongoing commitment to drafting the Stack Overflow Constitution, this week's amendment proposal comes from David: **PRO or CON: Should you have a 50 character max for the first line of your commit message?** 

Listen to the hosts' thoughts and then post your answer to Twitter using the Hashtag #StackOverflowPodcast with either PRO (in 50 characters or less!) or CON (using up to 140 characters). 

The best explanation, whether on the winning side or the losing side, will be read on next week's podcast and win a fabulous STACK OVERFLOW STICKER courtesy of the Stack Overflow Podcast. Also, please submit your ideas for future constitutional amendments on Twitter using #StackOverflowPodcast, and one of them might be named after you.

Last week's winner for the question: "**PRO or CON: If you are frequently switching back and forth between Macintosh and Windows, should you remap the COMMAND and the ALT key and vice/versa?**" is Daniel Allan White:

"CON. We CTRL our minds to adapt to the ALT keyboard layouts since there is no ESC from other machines in the world." - [@TheTrueAPlus](https://twitter.com/TheTrueAPlus/status/834097256252981248)
