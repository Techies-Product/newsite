**Introducion**

In this tutorial, we will explore the features of python. Let's start one by one.

**Simple and Easy to Use**

_"_If I am saying python is simple and very easy to use, then do not blindly believe me_"_ Go and just write the code in python and check that is simple or not.

Python is designed to be easy for the programmers to learn and use effectively. Python is seriously simple and a user-friendly type programming language. Python offers a more versatile structure and supports large programs than any other programming language and script do. It has few keywords with very simple structure.

**Free and Open Source**

Python is an example of a FLOSS(Free/Libre and Open Source Software). Means you can download freely distributed copies of the software, you can read complete source code, you can make a change to it. You can download python source code from the following link

[Download Python Source Code](https://github.com/python/cpython "Download Python Source Code")

**Interpreted**

When a program is written in any compiled language like in C, C++, Java or C# etc, first it translated from source code to Binary code (0s and 1s), which is understandable by a computer. A compiler compiles the source code and translates it into binary code. After then when you run or execute a program, linker and loader are used to store binary code to computer memory.

But python is interpreted language there is no separate compilation and execution steps. Python interpreter directly runs python code. Internally python interpreter converts the source code into bytecode (intermediate code) and then translates this into the native language of your specific computer and then run it, so there is no linker and loader.

**High-Level Language**

When you will try to write any program in python you will be never bothered about low-level details like memory and CPU used by the program because python is a High-Level programming language.

**Reliable**

Python offers error checking like C, C++, Java, C# etc. programming languages offer. It also provides high-level dynamic data types and flexibility. Reliability of code depends on your own skills and knowledge of your programming.

**Reusability**

In python, you can divide and split your program into several sets of modules which you can reuse later.

Python also provides some of the standard modules some of the modules are listed below

路 **sys**  
Access system-specific parameters and functions.

路 **math**  
It provides access to the mathematical functions.

路 **datetime**  
Basic date and time types

路 **io**Core tools for working with streams.

**Portable**

Python is a portable programming language. Suppose, say you write python code in Windows machine then you can run it on any platform like on Mac, Linux, Unix etc.

**Object Oriented**

Python is procedurally oriented as well as object-oriented.

**Dynamically Typed**

Python is dynamically typed language means when you create any variable in python the value of the variable is decided at the runtime.

**Extensible**

Python is extensible. If needed you can write some of your python code in other languages like C or C++.
